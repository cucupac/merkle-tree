## A Solidity Merkle Tree Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a merkle tree in the Solidity language. Given an array of bytes32 elements, the implementation constructs a merkle tree using the keccak256 hash function. The implementation also generates a merkle proof for proving tree-data membership.
